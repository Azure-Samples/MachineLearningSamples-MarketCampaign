There's a reason this bank's customer base is so strong--their customer service actually acts like people and not robots. I love that anytime my card is swiped, I'm instantly notified. And the built in budgeting app is something that really makes life easier. The biggest setback is not being able to deposit cash (you have to get a money order), and if you have another, non-simple bank account, transferring money between accounts can take a few days, which frankly isn't acceptable with most ACH taking a business day or less. Overall, it's a great bank, and I would recommend it to anyone."}], "type": "array", "items": {"properties": {"review": {"type": "string"}}, "type": "object"}}}}}
