4,"I absolutely love my bank. There's a reason this bank's customer base is so strong--their customer service actually acts like people and not robots. I love that anytime my card is swiped, I'm instantly notified. And the built in budgeting app is something that really makes life easier. The biggest setback is not being able to deposit cash (you have to get a money order), and if you have another, non-simple bank account, transferring money between accounts can take a few days, which frankly isn't acceptable with most ACH taking a business day or less. Overall, it's a great bank, and I would recommend it to anyone."
1,"International transaction fees for items bought domestically. Can't keep the account if you are overseas. Web interface sucks, unimportant data takes half the screen."
5,This bank bends over backwards for its customers. I've never been on hold for longer than 3 minutes. I'm never charged fees. My transactions are posted the minute I swipe my card. Their budgeting software has changed the way I manage money. Simple is the best bank I've ever had.
5,I have used this bank for going on two years and it’s the best bank ever. The app is amazing. Shared accounts are cool and just no fees it can’t get any better than this. 
5,"This card makes it so easy to save.... for rainy days, for trips, for ANYTHING. You dream it, Simple will help you save it. "
5,"My experience with the app, the banking services themselves, and the customer service team have been stellar. And I mean that in the sense that these people are STARS. The app has been awesome from the first version I used and keeps getting better. Every communication I've ever had with customer support has been like a conversation with a friend (or at least a friend of a friend). Sure, ultimately it's modern technology injected into a no-fee checking account, but **** are they getting it right."
5,"I applied for Simple after the Google wallet card was discontinued for the $20-on-signup promotion with the intention of taking the money and leaving the account. After a year and a half, I'm still using it. The well-designed web and app interfaces are a pleasure to use and support has always been very responsive to me. Their budgeting and categorization features are top-notch. 10/10."
5,I used to think I was just terrible at managing money. Fast forward a few years using Simple and I've managed to save money and purchase my first home. Now the money that used to go to overdrafts fees goes towards remodeling my home. Can't recommend them enough!
5,"As the name implies, this bank is so simple, straightforward, easy to use. It's helped me save and budget my money with their unique ""Safe To Spend"" and ""Goals"" features. Easy to deposit money. Customer service is quick, efficient and super helpful. The app is perfect and so easy to use. I love everything about Simple!"
1,Closed my account for no reason! Now customer service will not speak to me!!! Will I get my money back ?! Other sites say people never received their money!!!! 
1,"Simple has a beautiful and smart banking app.. but thats about it. Simple has awful customer service and communication with its members. They close accounts without explanation, freeze accounts that deposit checks and hold or take your money without any notice or timeline  when you'll get it back. In 2015 I discovered Simple Bank, attracted to its clean interface and non-traditional bank claims. "
5,"For the basics of banking, I would choose this checking account."
5,"Best bank I've ever had. Literally no fees for anything, ever. Everything you think you'll lose are all things I never used in the first place. It's everything I need and nothing I don't. The functionality is a bit lacking but that will change over time. As of now, you still need a traditional bank as backup for when you need to do very traditional things, such as buying a house or writing the occasional check but it's worth it."
5,"Excellent online, and mobile experiences. Best customer service across all industries."
1,I am living abroad and using SImple as my backup bank card. I lost my wallet a couple of days ago and found out to my horror that I can't log in to my Simple account online and that it keeps wanting a phone verification code which I am not receiving. I try to call their support phone number but it is out of service and they are not responding on Twitter or Facebook. It feels like there is no one operating or maintaining this organization which is considerably more of a problem since it is handling my money!
3,"Sure at first it was great. I enjoyed no fees it was awesome. But then it took a turn when an ATM stole money from me and there was little to no effort to get my money back. When I filed a dispute no one could tell me information, I had to wait almost a week for someone to message me. This company loves to give the run around. At first it seemed like they really valued me as a customer, but now not so much. Right now they are refusing to send me a card until I verify and address that I've already verified several times. Just don't do it, there will be times when you can't access your money! It's terrible. "
5,"Although Simple is a tech company and doesn't actually handle your money, they're great and you'd never know BBVA was involved if they didn't tell you! Safe to spend is awesome, their goals are amazing. I personally use Goals for short-term goals whereas some people may prefer to save long-term. People are more than 10 times more likely to post a negative review than a positive one so this review goes out there as an honest one! Please give this bank a try if you've been on the fence. I am a Chase Private Client and they're supposed to provide ""concierge"" banking, but that doesn't come close to what Simple offers. Genuine human goodness, just like they advertise! There is some sort of trust/psychological safety you'll have to establish since everything is handled online and over the phone app. It's worth it. They give you all the tools to succeed and their support website is phenomenal! "
5,Love this service. No more over spending and great way to watch your account.
1,"If you link an external account to simple, simple will freeze youre account until you can prove its your account. If you linked accounts are new like mine were, you will not be able to submit the required info which is 2 most recent monthly statements. My account has been frozen for 6 months. Customer service is a joke. Send in a message to customer support and it take 6-7 days to get a response. Stay away from this place."
5,"If you're just getting a bank account, or tired of mediocre apps and customer service, go with Simple. You'll still want to maintain independent brokerage/high-yield savings accounts, but for checking and small savings, absolutely great.  "
5,I've contacted support (text and phone) and always had an amazing experience.
5,"This bank is excellent. There are no overdraft fees, the customer service goes above and beyond, they calculate and give you statistics on your spending habits, and the app works really well. I strongly recommend this bank."
5,"Yes - if you have never banked with a branchless bank before it takes some adjustmetnt (duh). The mobile deposit limit starts at $2k otherwise you have to mail in the check UNLESS it's direct deposit (sure inconvenient but...how often does this come up nowadays). Like seriously - what a dumb thing to get mad about unless you are literally on the edge of getting evicted (which coincdentally this bank will help you budget for that better). If you deposit $5k+ there is a 5-day hold but there aren't any 'loops to jump through' (so...you know...just be patient). The customer service kicks that crap out of any traditional bank with which I have EVER banked - you can submit questions in-app from virtually any screen and get a response pretty quickly. I prefer this over calling an 800-number any day of the week, especially for menial stuff (ie ""Hey where do I mail a physical check to again?""). The goal setting/budgeting functionality is why to use this bank, in my opinion. It blows anything out of the water - and I've banked with Chase, BofA, HSBC, and Suntrust. I track ~30 categories monthly and have saved a ton as a result. Sign up, txfr a couple hundred bucks just to try it out, and then when you are comfortable make the full switch. Sounds like a few of the people who wrote negative reviews didn't want to take responsibility for the fact that they probably DIDN'T do this and instead when they tried to make a switch to a new style of banking all at once they got frustrated. "
5,"It's not just a name, it's literally the best thing to happen to personal banking ever. No fees ever. Free checking, instant transfer to other users, joint accounts, wow! It's simply the best... Better than all the rest!!!"
5,I love you guys! But not in a weird way. ...well I guess it's kinda weird. Aren't I supposed to hate you? You're a bank after all! :) I jumped on board with Simple as soon as I could because you said you'd be different than those other banks and you are! Every interaction I've had with customer service has been pleasant and you always go above and beyond.
5,GREAT!!!!!!!
1,They are not helpful the site does not work like it should when you ask for help they say there service is working and they want to blame everything under the sun as the actual issue and never there service.I just canceled my account never going back there again.
1,"If you open a checking account with Simple, they may, and probably will, block your account at some time, especially if you make a large deposit, and you will have to jump through hoops to get access to your money. I had banked with them for about 8 months before I made a larger than usual deposit, about $5000. The minute the deposit hit their system, they blocked my account and said I was 'unverified'. I followed every instruction they gave me and still couldn't become 'verified'.  They had never notified me of any problems with my status until this deposit.  The only problem I had before this was that utility companies and a number of other companies can not process payment through Simple because Simple does not process debits as many companies do.  More than once, I received unpaid notices and penalties from utility companies because their charges came back from Simple unpaid. There was plenty of money in my account, Simple just wouldn't pay because they later said they didn't have the ability to process. They don't tell you about this problem when you open an account with them.  I opened my account on the telephone - I asked plenty of questions and they had plenty of opportunities to mention the problems with their accounts. The rep did not mention any potential limitations or problems, nor did they mention that Simple is notorious for blocking accounts sporadically. This has happened to each and everyone I know that opened an account with them.  They even blocked my elderly mother's account and froze up her only source of income - her monthly Social Security retirement payment. She was told by their Customer Service Supervisor that she was too old to understand how to do things their way and he recommended that she get an account elsewhere. A complaint through the Federal Reserve had to be brought into this. The folks at Simple quickly got to the point that they would not respond when contacted by phone or email. There is absolutely no way to speak with anyone above their phone support team, although they often speak of the 'people who make their decisions'.  Their representatives are rude, arrogant and generally speak in a goofy, childish vocabulary that is inappropriate when speaking to someone about their money.  I also had to contact the Federal Reserve and other government offices (complaint still in process).  Another financial institution finally assisted and retrieved my money from them. BBVA Compass and Simple are bottom-feeders and should not be allowed to exist in this country."
1,"Avoid this bank at all costs! I have been using it for years and suddenly they have decided I can no longer have an account with them because of my temporary overseas contracts. Talking to them is like talking to a wall...they won't listen and have decided to close my account without all of the facts, when I called them about it they just kept saying it is impossible to reverse their decision. This has caused me more problems than I can count. Simple is a lie....not simple, a huge headache. RUN!!!!"
5,"My wife and I have two separate accounts for our ""mad money"". This could not be easier, every month money gets deposited into our accounts, and we spend it. If our funds are too low, the card will not let me go into overdraft. Transferring money between simple members takes 15 seconds, making paying back the other person for half the cost of a meal easy. "
5,They don't have any charges for any function. They have great budgeting tools as well as great support service and response time. Best bank I've ever had and they even help save some money.
5,"Simple is just that; Simple. None of the cruft and problems of big name banks that don't really care about you. They give you excelent tools (online, app) and your card for purchases and ATMs and then they get out of your way and don't give you any problems.If you have a problem or need help, you can write to them in the dead of the night and they'll answer your question or address your issue in 24h without having to call them on the phone. They have ""Goals"" to help you set aside money for savings and now they have shared accounts for sharing money goals, savings, and expenses with other people (not just joint account holders) with a minimum of problems."
5,"I've never had an issue with them, and their comunications have always been clear and direct."
5,"Simple is a completely online bank. I get an alert for every transaction instantly on my smartphone. I'm able to classify transactions based on predefined categories, and also create custom tags using the hashtag symbol for easy reporting. Creating goals is easy and you can move money in/out of goals just as simple. Funds moved into goals are still available in case you need it so transactions are not declined."
5,just a SIMPLE nonchecking account
5,"Simple has amazing customer service, an amazing app and web interface, and truly useful and intuitive tools to help plan spending and encourage saving.  Nothing bad to say, I think I had an issue once, and it was a pleasure to get in contact with them (I know that sounds weird, but I mean it), and they fixed it promptly."
5,Just try it. You'll be loving it.
1,"Beware!! Nothing convenient about it! They love to withhold your money and take days to transfer. Easily hacked, my account was hacked without my knowledge! I didn't get any verification via email or text letting me know someone linked their account to transfer my funds! Then they tried to close my account and would not send me my balance! Worst experience I've ever had!!!!! Never again! "
1,Do not even think about it!
2,"This bank used to be great.  I would refer everyone because customer support was so friendly and helpful.  During the past few months all of that has changed.  This bank has become unreliable and randomly closed my account after 3 years of banking with them due to a paperwork issue.  I even submitted everything that they wanted, but with no apology, no solutions offered, they just closed my account and told me I would have to apply again.  Absolutely rediculous.  Simple used to be good, but not anymore.  Don't bank here, there are many other options. "
1,"I was a happy Simple customer for four years, but my recent experiences have exposed some horrible policies. I'd been saving money into a Goal for months, toward a big purchase. I called Simple on a Tuesday to ask the best way to make a withdrawal. Two days later I made the withdrawal. The next morning I got a notification that my account had been frozen, and they needed to verify me.  I'd been a customer for four years, but suddenly I was not real? I called customer service and was told the following: the team that does ""customer verifications"" does not take phone calls. They also do not work on weekends, and they have no set schedule regarding how long an account can be frozen/locked/inaccessible. It could be a few days or a few months until they get around to verifying you,. They could not tell me why the account was frozen. I called again on Monday and asked if there was any way I could get access to my money. Same song and dance, I had to wait for the ""verification team"".  I spoke with a supervisor, who said he'd contact the verification team on my behalf, and ask them to please respond. The next day I got a response. First they required me to change my username and password. Once that was done, they told me that since someone else had attempted to verify as me (I have no proof of this) they were closing my account. So apparently their policy is to cancel customer accounts, rather than try to figure out what happened. I have no idea if someone actually tried to pretend to be me, but wouldn't a company with reasonable customer service at least try to help the victim of attempted identity theft, instead of just randomly closing accounts?  And as a final kick in the teeth - if they throw you out because someone attempts to gain access to your account, and you still have any interest in keeping your account, don't bother. They claim they have no way to make a new account for a person who used to have one.  Ridiculous. So now I have to wait for them to get around to sending me a check, in the mail, to get my funds back.  Horrible experience. I will no longer recommend them for anything.  "
5,It's super easy to manage your money and actually spend less with the 'Save to Spend' feature. Easy to stash away money for bills and for saving.
5,"I've tried chime and afew other online banks, simple is the best one yet."
1,"If they question a deposit, they don't ask for proof of validation....they just shut down your account with no recourse. Thank god I had no money in the account or I wouldn't have received it. I had them for 2 years when they were with bancorp with no problems, within two  months of switching to their new BBVA account, I've been shut down for NO VALID REASON WHATSOEVER! In addition, my daughter had previously signed up for an account, and they put her through a hell of a loop trying to verify with document and document being requested to upload....and then denied her account, I was ready to leave them after that but I had already set up my tax refund to be sent to the account so I was stuck for the moment. If this is how they treat customers, good riddance, I'll go elsewhere!"
1,"The app itself is very functional, but the way the handled transferring partners was terrible. My license expired right as they needed new documentation for their partner and completely closed my account. Now I'm left moneyless with no access to my funds trying to figure out how I'm supposed to pay rent and buy food. I've never had such a terrible situation in my life and there is apparently nothing they can do about it."
5,GREAT Bank
5,"It really is Simple. The app is simple, the account is simple to setup. Catagorizing transactions and keeping records is simple. Simple simple simple. Oh and don't even get me started on the goals feature. Super Awesome!Customer service has been great. I love that I can just message them for non-emergency questions and then before I know it, They've answered my questions with a high degree if professionalism mixed with a little charm and humor.I have yet to have any emergency issues to deal with."
5,"It is an online bank, but it's so easy to get around. The app is full of features like fingerprint login, push notifications, plus Android pay"
1,"I filed a complaint with the BBB and the FDIC because Simple froze my account without warning. I recently changed my address, which took 2-3 days for them to approve, but after they approved it they asked for my ID, social security card, two months of recent bank statements from my linked external account and a utility bill to prove my address. Why didn't they ask for all of that before they approved the address change? Now I have $372 in the account that I can't use and I did not receive my most recent direct deposit from my job because of this mess. I sent them my ID and social security card and called to explain that due to my personal circumstance that I could not provide a utility bill or bank statements and I was told that there was nothing the bank could do to move forward in unfreezing my account until I gave them those documents. I asked how long the process would take and the customer service rep said that she didn't know. I asked if I could speak with someone who would have more information and was told that there was no one else except for the supervisor. The supervisor is not part of the team that reviews accounts and documents. Apparently, I couldn't speak to anyone on that team even though I asked. I spoke with the supervisor and I asked them to close the account and was told that they needed to verify the account before they could close it. So now my money is stuck in limbo until whenever. Based on other complaints I've read, even those who were able and did provide the documents Simple requested still had to go through hoops to get their money, if they ever got it. I understand identity protection, but this is ridiculous. I've been using the account for months now and never had a problem until this past week. I have tried reaching out again by email, but have yet to receive a response, but if I post on their social media accounts I get a reply telling me to contact customer service. I have supplied every access code they have given me to verify my identity. I sent them photographs of my original, unaltered, unexpired social security card and state-issued ID. I haven't heard anything and was told that it could take days or weeks to unfreeze once they did receive everything they asked for. It doesn't seem like it's legal for them to hold my money like this. Terrible experience!"
2,"I recently changed the address associated with my checking account with Simple Bank. On 3/28 I received confirmation that the address had been successfully changed to what I requested. I received notice that my checking account with Simple Bank was frozen on 3/30/2017 because Simple could not verify my address. They requested a copy of my unexpired ID, my social security card, two most recent bank statements from the external accounts linked to my Simple account and Residence verification such as a bill. I replied to their email with my ID and social security card, however I could not fulfill their request to supply two recent bank statements for an external account linked to my Simple Bank checking account nor could I supply a bill in my name with the address on my Simple account because I am not responsible for any of the household bills at that address. I explained in both that email and in a phone call placed on 3/31/2017 that I could not provide those things. I was told that until Simple received the documents they requested that they wouldn't be able to move forward in unfreezing my funds. I asked them to close the account, but they replied that they would still need the documents requested before they could close the account. My complaint is I feel that Simple Bank should have requested this information before they approved my address change and subsequently froze my account. I work very hard for my money and I trusted that I would have easy and simple access to it by using Simple's services, but now I do not have it. I feel that if Simple Bank needed to verify my address, then they should have done so before they approved the address change. I have been left without access to my money and based on other customers' experiences that I have read, the process could take a significant amount of time, which I cannot afford. I need access to my money and Simple Bank is blocking me. I have never ever had this issue with any other institution that I have banked with. "
2,"The past couple of months using Simple have been great--right up until yesterday when I received notice that my account was frozen because they were having trouble with verifying my address. I suppose that was triggered when I changed the address. I changed it online, a couple of days later I received confirmation that the change was successful. Then, yesterday I received an email asking me for my ID, social security card, two most recent bank statements from a linked bank account, and a bill to prove my address. Why didn't they ask for all this when I first changed the address? I sent my ID and social security card, but the bank statements and utility bill I could not provide because of a personal situation that I tried to explain in both an email and a phone call. I was told that until Simple received all of the documents they required that they could not move forward with reviewing and unfreezing my account. That is a huge inconvenience since I was set to receive a direct deposit from my employer on top of the money I already have in the account. Based on what I have read of other customers' experiences, it looks like the verification requirements are never-ending and I simply do not have the time or patience to deal with this. When I asked to close the account I was told that since it was up for review that it could not be closed until I sent in a bank statement and proof of address. I just want my money that I go to work everyday to earn. I really enjoyed getting the mobile alerts when my card was used and I liked that there aren't any fees associated with the account, unless you consider the money that I currently don't and apparently won't have access to anytime in the near future as payment for my use of the account. The representatives apologized for the inconvenience, but I don't need apologies, I need my money. Keeping the customers secure is extremely important, but this is ridiculous. With all of the hoops I have to go through to even login to my account online or on the app, it doesn't seem like I would need to do anything else outside of sending my government issued ID and social security card to prove who I am. I need my money, simple as that. Since 3/31/2017 I have made a post to their official Facebook page and to their page in the Google Play Store where the Simple app is listed and Simple has responded to both posts instructing me to contact their customer service department, but have not yet replied to any of my emails using their secure server in response to their inquiry about my address. I still do not have access to my funds and I am afraid of sending more personal identifying information to this company as I have already sent them photographs of my original social security card and my unexpired state-issued ID card. I feel that their business practices are shady and not at all transparent. I will not accept their excuse of not being able to solve this dispute because it violates their Privacy Policy when their policy states that it discloses nonpublic personal information to non-affiliated third parties for everyday business purposes ""With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information."" With all of the hoops I have to go through to even login to my account online or on the app, it doesn't seem like I would need to do anything else outside of sending my government issued ID and social security card to prove who I am. I need my money."
1,Long time customer from the start. I had my account closed without explanation and it took me over a month to get my funds returned to me. Think twice!
1,"When I first started using Simple I was pretty excited. Their back-end online banking system was beautiful and easy to use and they didn't have any crazy charges - excellent switch from BofA. As I continued using it however, I realized that I wasn't able to do simple things such as transfer money to others, (you're only allowed to transfer to external accounts that you own), send checks in less than a week and sometimes I couldn't even deposit checks through their online system - they require you to mail in checks over a certain dollar amount. I had to get a second bank account, in order to function in everyday society. That was fine, I was at least able to externally transfer funds to my new account when I needed to get money to others. My most frustrating experience with Simple, however, came today when I received an email saying that on May 1 (It's March 30) they are closing my account, as I hadn't yet verified my new home address. There was no warning of ""this may potentially happen if you don't verify your address by x date"" just a ""simple:"" We're closing your account. You can apply for another one, but no matter what you do, you're unable to keep this account. So now I have to unexpectedly reschedule all my auto-pays and deposits and transfer all my cash. I am pretty frustrated to say the least. If you're looking for a simple solution to online banking, this is not it. "
1,"I really liked Simple. Really did. When I moved, I contacted them, changed address. Even contacted Customer Support to correct that they had wrong zip. Fixed it. Was told everything good to go. This was on October 2016. Now I get notified that they have to close my account because they couldn't verify my new address? This is the first i've heard of it. Called Customer Support when I got the message. First call, was answered and promptly hung up. Awesome job. Second call answered. After being on hold a bit, rep came back and said they should have asked for documents and didn't. Sorry. But we have committed to closing the account, so we will. But you can open a new one after. I'll pass. You guys had such potential but have turned out to be garbage."
4,"Simple offers a good product for those who don't have very many assets and/or don't require brick and mortar services.  Its great for those starting out in life, like college students etc. it allows them to easily track their spending and set goals.  I had this account right up until I purchased my first property, which proved to be more trouble than it was worth.  That being said, the customer service at Simple is awesome, they were always super helpful.      "
2,"based on my experience. Good. Very simple as the name implies. I used it mostly for some auto payments and for goals, which is an awesome feature. Not having a physical branch didn't bother me because Simple wasn't my primary bank account. I also never had any fees charged to my account,Bad. A few months ago they changed their partnering bank so I had to go through the process of changing account number, routing number and debit card. Aside from the temporary hassle that goes with that, once complete that was done and dealt with... no biggie.A few weeks after that I started seeing several transfers to and from my own accounts (from Simple to my other bank account and vice versa). I know I did not do those. It seemed like they were creating the transfers themselves as most of them were under $1, and sometimes under $2. When I reached out to them, they first told me my account was hacked and forced me to change my user name and password, which I did. The following day, however, I got a message that my account had been compromised and they would have to close it altogether. And in that same message they were ""sorry to say"" that they were unable to offer me a new account at the time.  Summary, it was an ok experience overall, but I'm glad I never made them my primary bank account. And given the latest troubles I'm not sure I'll be eager to go back if they were to offer me a new account in the future."
1,I'm going back to a bank with brick and mortar branches so I can get actual banking done with ease.
5,Goals are the best feature. Budgeting built-in.
5,"I've been using Simple for 4 or 5 years... I first got my card back when they were doing invite-only beta testing and I've never looked back.  The app is intuitive and easy to use; it's the only budgeting tool that has ever worked for me.  The support team is amazing; responses within 24 hours always, from real people who take the time to understand my issue and genuinely want to help.  The lack of fees is refreshing and gracious in today's banking world.  The card is cool looking (we're all a little vain).  Long story short, Simple is the bright spot in an industry that makes me anxious and worried.  I can't say enough good things about them."
5,Love the app and service. Quick replies.
5,"Love the service, quick replys and the mobile app is great."
5,"Amazing customer service, fast deposits. Absolutely love this bank!"
5,"For those worried about an online-exclusive bank, please don't worry about this one! Their customer service team is the best I've ever had to talk to, and they always solve any issues I've had with a smile! I quit my credit union for these guys, and it was the best decision I ever made! If you want a bank that won't punish you with fees, go with this one. It's so great, I tell all my friends about it!"
2,"The application process was smooth. The online system is great.  I like the feature where they will mail out a physical check if needed. Fees?   Practically non-existent.  But the one major negative is the very poor processing of physical checks mailed to them for deposit.  My last deposit (and I do mean my last) with them, I sent in three checks. One got processed in nearly two weeks.  The other two they couldn't find, and then finally got them going after more than another week had passed. I have been told repeatedly that USPS first class mail take ""about a week"" to get there.  Nonsense.  The USPS site shows 2-3 days and in my personal experience, I get mail locally or across the country in two days in just about all cases, occasionally three...maybe once a year I'll get one or two beyond three days.  Yet any time I have sent in checks, it takes a least a week.  Even when I sent them my first deposit via an overnight envelope to their suggested physical address, it still took days for them to process the deposit.With the backing bank changing to BVVA Compass, I will likely be leaving them, as I have heard nothing but really bad reviews of that bank.  I am already having to find a credit union locally to replace them, and then I'm back to worrying about all the fees and find print that these institutions sneak in on you."
4,"Customer service is awesome. Connected with a human in less than a minute. The online aspect of the banking is for a lack of better word, simple. My only gripe is the cash deposit inconvenience but you'll work around it. "
5,I am a Dave Ramsey fan and live by the principles he teaches for Goals and Budgets. Simple has made those steps easier than any other traditional or online bank ever has. They were the first to allow me to block access to my card and their transfers are quick. The interface is elegant and easy to use. Their customer service is the best in the industry! I literally cannot say enough good things about them. 
3,"...But not much beyond that. I've had my Simple account since 2013 and loved it in the beginning. I was able to save easily, customer service was great, etc. Not being able to deposit cash is annoying but not really a deal breaker. Fast forward to last year when I tried to buy a house. Simple had no way of wiring funds when I closed, and suggested I send the mortgage company a traveler's check instead, which isn't accepted for extremely large sums (like when buying a house). Luckily for me I went in with someone else who is with a credit union, so I was able to transfer that money to him before we closed. Transferring large sums like this right before closing is strongly discouraged by mortgage companies and increases the chances of being declined. (I had to make many phone calls to my mortgage complany and their bank, and essientially be given permission for this transaction. All days before we closed.) This was incredibly stressful on top of the normal stresses of buying a house. A couple of months later I opened an account with the same credit union for easier transfering of money, although I kept Simple as my primary account. This year Simple has changed to a new parent bank, BBVA Compass, and I'm not sure if the wiring situation will change or not. However I've had problems with migrating my account to this new bank. I submitted all the new account information for direct deposit to my payroll servces, instructed by Simple, and was told to wait for a nofitication (from Simple) that my direct deposit had gone through. Well, it's been nearly a month and one round of paychecks and I still don't have access to the new account, or my paycheck. My mortgage is coming up soon and it appears that my money has gone through to the new account, only I can't finish migrating over. This was discovered during a conversation with one of Simple's reps, who has not yet gotten back to me on how I can access my new account. I'm just sort of left stranded with dwindling savings and no idea when or if I can get my money soon (or at all). I really wish more banks had the same user interface features as Simple or that Simple wouldn't have these strange problems. Day-to-day scenarios are usually fine, but if anything weird happens it's a confusing, painful process to be sorted out, oftentimes creating a tedious workaround with other banks because Simple doesn't offer something basic, like wiring funds. Glad I didn't have them when I studied abroad! It may be time to take the leap to a fully ""adult"" credit union. "
1,... because they said I was abroad too often. i travel for business a few times a year for 2 months at a time. No toher bank/broker/credit card company has an issue with (actually they probably appreciate the foreign currency and internation ATM fees they charge me). Bu Simple said no and determined they had to close my account. BAD
1,"I opened my bank account in Nov. 2016 for my wedding money that was given to me, they were going to be adding shared accounts so that my fiance and I would both be able to access the money. As soon as I deposited the first check, my account was frozen due to Simple needing verification documents. I sent my documents and called to confirm they had what they needed. The agent was very kind and stated to expect a support message from the ""Verification"" team later that day. 24 hours later I still had no message so I called to ensure that they didn't need anything. The caller stated that this process takes time and that they would get back with me. I asked the agent what kind of time we were talking and she stated she had no idea, but that they would get back to me. I allowed 4 days to pass, and still heard nothing. Mind you, my account and MY money was locked. I then called and spoke with someone again who stated she couldn't tell me when the team would review my documents, nor would I be able to speak with that team. I even spoke with 2 different managers who stated they couldn't give me any answers but that it would take time for them to unlock my account. Not to mention, the final phone call I had with them the two support team members were rude, condescending, and absolutely robotic in their responses. "
1,"For day to day transactions, Simple is efficient as an online bank should be. If there are any issues with the account, however, the customer service provided is bare minimum. It is worse than any public utility company, or cable provider offers. They are polite, but they will not solve your problem. They do not have phone reps that can handle complex issues either, all escalations are handled via email. Essentially, if they make any errors that result in your assets being frozen or possibly misappropriated, then you will not be able to get them back."

5,"Sometimes it can be difficult to deal with a bank that has not physical presence, but Simple does a good job of minimizing that pain.  Their website and apps are great and provide quick and easy access to my account information and a customer  support rep if I'm having trouble."
5,"easy to use, great communication...simple makes me feel like I have a friend to rely on who keeps better track of my funds than I do! user friendly, in the best possible way. customer service is never less than stellar, always. they are fast, trustworthy, and always looking out for your best interest. simple lives up to the name, couldn't say enough good things!"

1,If you use a proxy they may assume the worst and lock your card under their interpretation of the Money Laundering terms of the Patriot Act. Once locked you will be restricted to ACH transfers only. This has happened to me and two of my friends. Customer support is clueless.
5,"Banking always seemed a pain. However, Simple doeas a fantastic job of pushing the ""save everyday"" and ""envelope budget"" ideas directly to yor money which makes the process very direct. My experience at the beginning in 2014 was a tad rough at first to get started (this being a new concept). However, once settled and using all the tools offered, it shines very nicely. I do recommend trying them out, but to really ""try"" it. You have to commit 100% to make it work. Using it halfway can get convoluted."
5,"This bank is banking stripped down to just what you want.  No fees. There just aren't fees. I used this card in the US, Europe, Spain, and Mexico and I was able to avoid any fee. I've also overdrafted. No fees for that either. The app is sleek, shiny and easy. Store money in digital envelopes. Spend money from those envelopes or a ""safe to spend balance"". Make goals that draw from Safe to Spend on a regular basis without having to think about it. This visual partitioning of my money has been incredibly effective in helping pay off my credit cards, begin saving and getting off the paycheck to paycheck cycle that I've been a slave to for my whole life. And the service? Insanely personal and helpful. They respond to text messages faster than a guy from Tinder who wants to know if you're up. Even better, Simple service is way more into committed, long term relationships. "
5,"Love it!  Used it for almost a year and it beats my main bank by far.  Early deposits, no fees."
5,"The app and website are beautiful and super easy to use. The goals make managing money incredible easy. I never use checks, so I'm fine with not having any, and anyway, their check-mailing system is great - just say where you want it to go and when, and they'll send one.I also never deal with cash, so I have no problems depositing all my checks with a picture. I've *never* had to mail them a check that wouldn't deposit through a picture, and I've been with them 3 years. In the rare occassion I do have to deposit cash, it's no big deal for me to stop at a grocery store, pay $0.75, and get a money order. It's basically the same process as going to an actual bank branch for other banks. The only trade off is features. Again, it's a Simple bank, and it's perfect for me, but there will obviously be banks with more features like higher returns, credit card offers, etc."
4,"If you need help getting a budget together, or are so thrown off by how you look at your finances right now - this bank and its app will help you get a grip on it all. Much like ""envelope budgeting"" their mobile banking app allows you to separate your money into different ""goals"" for your bills, savings, transfers, whatever. Once you have put all the necessary money into these ""goals"" you'll have money left over in your ""safe-to-spend"" which means this is your discretionary income! How awesome is that! Once a transaction hits that is assigned a goal (say your cell phone bill) then just click the transaction and tell the app to pull the money from your ""goal"". This is literally the best banking app I've ever come across. Pros: Budgeting software, Customer Service (A+++), 1-Biz Day Outgoing ACH Transfers Cons: Bill Pay is really slow. I would have given them 5 stars, but I can transfer money to my Navy Federal acccount and then process a bill pay and it's faster than Simple's current process. (They have said they are looking to change it, so this may not always be an issue.) "
4,"Simple currently offers single-user accounts with an elegant web interface and app. Their customer service is top-notch. They respond to messages promptly and if you ever need to call an actual person answers the phone! Their best feature is ""Goals,"" essentially a system to set aside money from your balance automatically for planned purchases. You see a ""Safe-to-Spend"" amount when you open the app so you know what's available that hasn't been otherwise allocated. For me, this has allowed me to actually save money for the first time in my life. Having a $10k checking account balance before Simple would have been unthinkable, now I carry that regularly and am building my savings on a regular basis. I've been able to make new computer purchases, take several vacations, and set aside emergency funds all due to this automatic saving."
5,"its easy to use. no problems at the atm. and i LOVE the ""safe to spend"" feature"
1,"I had a Simple checking account and at one point there was a security data breach. My account had been compromised and instead of blocking access to the offending hack they froze my account, started procedures to close the accout, blocking me from EVER getting a new account and blocking me from my own money! This all occurred two days before my employment direct deposit hit. I had no time to re-direct the deposit to another account and I was blocked from accessing the funds when they did get deposited. I'm currently facing eviction from my appartment because I haven't been able to pay my rent because of this error on the banks' side! I'm furious, speechless with anger. I can't even describe how violated I feel! "
1,"Long story short, I waited two weeks for my debit card and still waiting. I have been with them for a year. They do not respond timely. They mailed three different debit cards to a wrong address. When I asked them to record my feedback, they simply ignored it. They will not help you. The interest sucks. Go with Ally or a Credit Union. "
5,I haven't had to use my Wells Fargo account in years. Just wish Simple did mortgages!
5,"I've been with Simple since the beginning and I love them. I recommend them to everyone. They make banking so easy for me, with the tools I want for managing my money.  Their customer service has never once been anything less that perfectly helpful. They always respond prompted to support chat messages. This is so flipping easy! If Simple was a man I'd marry him."
1,This is not a bank. Scam. Horrible customer service. It's an app that's all. If you need a real bank that can serve a normal consumer in 2016 look elsewhere. 
1,"Simple.I'm closing my account with Simple this week because of their arbitrary and inconsistent application of their policies, and don’t give notice to customers when they decide to change their policies (or in this case, enforce an unknown policy that was never enforced before). I normally have a direct deposit split between my traditional credit union and Simple. Pretty frequently over the past year or two, I would write a check from my credit union and deposit it in Simple with their app. Easy, secure, never had any problems with deposits. It is also much faster to deposit a check than an external account transfer, which is usually a couple of days late if they work at all. Three days ago, I went to do the same thing and my deposit was rejected. I was informed because my name was on both accounts I cannot deposit that check. Now, this normally wouldn’t be a big deal, although frustrating, but I just switched jobs and my direct deposit has not been set up yet. In my budgeting timeframe, I had planned on that deposit working, just as it has in the past. That means all my automatic payments - think housing payment, student loans, car payment, everything, will be late and I’ll be hit with late fees (and probably a credit score drop) because their customer service flat out refused to help me out with depositing this check and told me it was impossible. They have taken a “hard line” in June 2016 with this policy that I’ve never heard of and was never informed of. Well, it’s November I have certainly deposited many of my checks since June. Impossible? No. Stubborn? Yes. Completely unwilling to help a customer? Absolutely. So if you want impersonal, canned customer service (“I’m sorry”, “I understand that must be frustrating”, “Have a great day!”), you will never change jobs or direct deposit methods, and you’re OK with external transfers that always complete two business days after the date they quote you, then go ahead, sign up with Stupid Simple. And this was all to put a few thousand dollars INTO the bank. That’s what a bank wants their customers to do, right?"
5,Bank is all online. Very easy to use and the app is great. Many ways to save money with this bank. No mothly fees. Only down fall is there is no way to deposit cash at this point.
5,"I love everything about Simple, from the user interface, to Goals, to the general polish across the whole experience.  My only concern is the lack of Joint Accounts.  However, Joint Accounts are in Beta, so I'm excited to see what Simple will come up with!"
5,"Excellent mobile app that's updated frequently. Good website. Customer services responds VERY fast and is available via chat or phone. No fees. Ever. Other banks I've used in the past include Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and a small local bank."
5,"I've been using Simple since the invite-only days. Their customer service is impeccable, their lack of overdraft fees is great (if you have an ""OOPS!"" moment you don't need to battle it out like with Bank of America), their goal and Safe-to-Spend features are unique and consistent across devices, the apps are clean, and many many large chains (CVS, 7-Eleven, Walgreens, gas stations) allow withdrawal of funds without a fee (Allpoint systems). I would recommend them, twice."
5,Makes budgeting and financial accountabilty so easy!
5,"One of my coworkers told me about simple and I absolutely love it. As a freelancer I sometimes live paycheck to paycheck...not worrying about how much I'm going to be charge for how little I have in my account has been a dream. Also the fact that you get an alert everytime your card is used is magnificent, it actually helped me refute a purchase that was made at GameStop for 56.99. I admit the lack of ATMs is a little annoying and so is the inablity to desposit cash, but these are all minor compared to the fact that I have actually started managing my money so much more effectively with Simple. Simple is better than any big bank I've ever used and I've been with Wells Fargo, Chase, and BOA. "
5,"I love the bank but , I wish it have a higher withdrawal each day An some where I can put money into it daily! "
1,"This bank should get no stars. I had someone write me a bad check, first time I ever had an OD in simple. They blocked my account, CS on the phone hangs up on you with no information and no explanation. They don't respond to the support messages. I wasn't given any chance to correct the OD and was turn to collections. Absolutely worst bank, totally a scam. Don't fall for the 'no fees'bright an shinny. The treat you like trash. Should have a 'No Star' option."
1,"I have never encountered customer service as poor as Simple Bank. It has been 1 month and they still have no sent me a new debit card. They lied about sending one out, blamed it on the courier - super unproffesional. It's like you're interacting with some uneducated kids in college on the other end. It's been so long my address has changed and now they want photos of me in front of my house holding my license.. I sent 3 photos, they want more. Furious with this bank, if I had another option I would immediatley transfer my funds, but that will have to wait til next week. I will rate this bank 1 star on every possible website for all they have put me through."
1,"At the start I was happy with the banking services Simple offers. After using it for a few years, unfortunately I feel strongly that I need to put a review out there to let people know the difficult experiences I had, which ultimately caused me to leave its customer base.If you are an entrepreneur, small business owner OR aspire to become one- THIS IS NOT THE BANKING SERVICE FOR YOU.Simple banking does not provide a way for its users to deposit cash. While at the start this was a minor inconvenience for me, it became more problematic for me later.My experience using their electronic check feature earns them a 'one star' rating. On several occasions the persons that were meant to receive the check I sent through Simple's system- never received them and I had to go through a process of contacting Simple customer service and get the checks sent a second time. This caused me extra time, inconvenience and worry and I lost confidence in the checking system all together.This brings me to my ""last straw"" issue- I am a hairstylist- I worked as an employee and recently started renting a chair at a salon. This is a fairly minor change in the big picture of my job reality- but it meant that I needed to be able to start depositing cash on a regular basis. I went to a credit union and opened A PERSONAL ACCOUNT there- simple so I had the ability to deposit cash and write reliable checks as needed. This additional account is not classified as a business account and it is in my name only. - I then tried to write myself a check out of my personal credit union account into my simple account- at which time Simple declined it and specifically told me that I could not deposit a personal check to myself from another account. The message also told me to instead set up an external transaction account feature with in Simple- which has to be in my name specifically. So that is what I did. The external account connection was set up successfully and when I had a question about it- I called Simple's customer service- out of ignorance- I told the woman that I was in part using this new account for business. Who knew that would be such a big deal. I was told that connection with business accounts was not allowed and that I needed to disconnect that external transaction feature immediately. This is incredibly inconveniencing to me- because now I have absolutely no way to move money between my two accounts.For those reading this- SIMPLE DOES NOT ALLOW SIMPLE ACCOUNTS TO BE USED AS  BUSINESS RELATED ACCOUNTS AND DOES NOT ALLOW ANY ASSOCIATION WITH what they deem to be BUSINESS RELATED ACCOUNTS. can not recommend Simple to anyone who owns a small business- or would like to start one in the future. I am taken aback by this policy. There is NO ROOM FOR GROWTH with in this banking system. I was enamored with and drawn in by the 'simple' user interface and the youthful modern vibe the culture of the customer service people presents. BEWARE- because under that appealing interface is a big business rigid banking system (BANCORP+) that does not allow its users any options or the ability to grow their personal finances.I had no option but to close out my Simple account and move entirely into credit union accounts. Again, extra time, headache and inconvenience for me.Final verdict-The name of the company should be 'Basic' rather than 'Simple'Its lack of options/ services proves to be inconveniencing in the long run.Dont be fooled by the modern friendly interface- its a big business bank with limited services."
1,"This bank seems great until you have an issue. My card was locked from use for absolutely no reason and my funds frozen. You cannot reach anyone to help. CSRs literally say I cannot help you I'm disconnecting the call without any information!! Then you try to use their ""support"" and noone can get back to you. So yea its pretty and shiny on the outside,but there is nodepth to this company. They currently have my money locked with no way to get it out."
5,"This is everything  I needed from a bank that's brick and motar. No frills, just your account, and helping establish goals to better manage your money. Super friendly customer service. Only issue is that I wish they we're a tad faster witht the tech features...but they're already ahead of most."
5,wonderful support and easy to use.
4,"Not for those living paycheck to paycheck, if you don't read the very clearly stated policies you will be frustrated. But not too worry, the superb support team (except one overzealous gal who blocked my card) will answer your call,no phone tree or long wait."
5,"easy to use, no monthly fees, no need to visit a branch to open, my only complain is that deposit from another account is a little hide, take a while to find that option, should be easier to add funds from other bank account, transfers from your bank take up to 4 days"
5,"No fees not trouble... neutral points, no checkbook, it takes upto 4 business days to get the full amount of your deposit over $100. The app for check deposits sometimes takes blurry pictures of the check and you have to reporcess the check. But all this is classic for Online banking only banks. Their goal is that you autodeposit your check and you spend it on the ATM card because that is how they make their money...Nothing wrong with that... just beware if it fits your lifestyle."
5,Wonderful
5,"First, this is a real bank. Yes, they want your business. But sometimes when isues or flags are raised, they like ALL OTHER financial institutions, require fact checking paperword from potential customers. This is called....Good Business ! It protects them, but moreso it protects you and I. It keeps their service FREE !!! If they allowed every flag to pass through, well then, sure enough the fraud community would make ""Simple"" their object of attack !! Every member would start paying monthy fee's. So..... if they ask, simply givde them the proof that you are real. It's really that simple. Yes, some innocent folks do get caught up in the process. But they also get their funds back if they decide to cancel out after the fraud departent concludes their work. But why would any honest person say no to free banking. Most complainers are morons....there's always a reason that a bank freezes ones assets that are on deposit. These people are either shady, or they were at some point !  You'd be foolish to pay for banking, when you can get it free, right here ! "
5,Simple changed the way I manage my banking and made it way easier to track and save money. There support team is also amazing and everyone once in a while will send a fun gif. 
5,"The bank is really really simple, so the name. The easiest banking experience I have ever had. Customer service is exceptionally good."
1,I enthusiastically joined Simple. I was excited when my card arrived. I played around with the app setting up goals. It was great until I had my first direct deposit. My job deposited money on Tuesday I started paying bills this is where I hit my first problem.Even though Simple is an online bank they send checks for bill pay. They literally cannot do electronic bill pay. Which is fine because I can initiate the payment from the billing company. This is where I found problem number 2. You cannot budget money for an inbound payment. If you know your credit card is going to deduct $100 for a payment you can't budget $100. Instead you have to set up a goal of $100 for your payment. When the payment hits your account the money is taken from your safe to spend. You have to go and edit the transaction to take the money from the goal you set up. You have to do this process for every bill you wanted to budget for and you have to do it every month manually if you have a recurring payment. With that said my biggest problem came on Thursday when I was checking my account for cleared transactions. I had a message that my card was blocked. I call customer support and they could not tell me want the issue was. I was told I would get an email from support. I called throughout the day for updates and every person said the exact same thing. I don't know what's wrong wait for an email from support. 36 hours later I get an email from support saying they cannot verify my direct deposit and need a copy of my paystub. I have never had a problem with a direct deposit before. I send them the requested documents at 11 and at 1 call because I never get confirmation they received them. The rep says yeah they're here I'll forward them to the review team. So if hadn't called they wouldn't have been forwarded. When I ask how long does this process takes I was told I don't know wait for a support email. This seems to be the typical response from them. I ask to speak with a manager and I get one on the phone who says she will email me with an update at 5. At 530 I call because I didn't get an update and she's busy so I can't speak to her. Every time I call back the manager is busy until she leaves for the day. Now we're on a 3 day weekend and I still don't have to my money or any status on the review. Needless to say my account will be closed asap.
4,Had a recent fraud issue via atm use and their support team kept in touch a full week and ultimately provided a credit for the loss within a few days. Very impressed.
1,apparently a deposit was made into my account without my knowledge .. when i called and explained the situation the lady goes i can no longer continue this call and if you need additional support email them and hangs up. when i called back the second time to speak to the supervisor there was no supervisor around (typical) and when i explained the situation i got the exact same response and said i want to speak to a supervisor now and the girl hung up. insanely unprofessional and rude . BEWARE!! 
5,"Ive had my simple account for over a year now. Ive had chase, and wells before. I hated them both! Simple is very easy and basic to use. The customer service is also VERY good. They usually always answer within 24 hours. Ive never had a bad customer service rep, plus you can deal with them completely online so you dont need to wait  on the phone."
5,No fees; Even when my account went inactive for months! I love my BANK account. No drama just SIMPLE. 
1,"Wow, where do I start?  The beginning was excellent. It was like playing with a new toy. You cannot wait to whip out the white card, and tell all your friends about how you have an account at a new bank! You might even refer your friends to the bank (which I regret that I did).  It is a startup in Oregon, so it gives you a cool hipster feeling that everything is going to be all right. Well.. That is when things start to happen:"
5,I could not speak more highly about simple. Trully elegant and powerful tool to manage your personal finaces.
1,"I should have left  the time when they conducted a massive upgrade a couple of years back that left thousands (including me) without access to their account for weeks. I didn't even know what my balance was because the system crashed and couldn't tally it accurately. It was a complete nightmare. I should have fled then but I was foolish. "
5,"I wanted a straight debit card account similar to Green Dot but without the fees, and that’s Simple. No fees. Friendly customer service. Simple reps and the interface seem to reflect a true desire to serve and to provide bank service that works. I feel welcome and wanted and respected. Too often, debit card services act as if I'm doing them a favor by letting them handle my money. The reps (at some other services) are uninformed and they don't show enthusiasm for their product. Simple is a better experience. However, Simple is NOT a full-service bank. You can’t write a check or make a deposit at a branch or local ATM in the same way that you can with most major banks. Similarly, while Simple will handle money transfers and payments like a bank, the Simple system is clearly focused more on card transactions because that is how Simple earns money, via processing fees paid by vendors. Judging Simple against full-service banks, it comes up short. If you want a full bank, try something like Wells Fargo. But judging against debit-card services, Simple is a champ and far superior to competitors like Green Dot. For this reason, I recommend it. "
5,If you want to keep it simple sign up today!
5,"The thing I like most about Simple is the fast and minimalist online banking platform.  Simple has a fast and easy to use website and the most impressive feature is their goals functionaity.  While it is cool to be able to save for a goal over time, I use goals as virtual envelops or sub-accounts.  So after I get my paycheck depositted I drag money over to my goals for each of my monthly bills.  This adjusts my ""safe-to-spend"" balance so that I know exactly how much is left after budgeting.  Then when my bills actually get paid, I just select the transaction and choose to pay that transaction from the goal which takes it out of the virtual envelope. "
5,"These guys are amazing. Best customer service I've ever recieved. When you call, you don't have to go through any menus. They're incredibly helpful, kind, and respectful. The mobile app is incredibly well designed and I love love love the goals feature. Probably the only thing that sucks is the check deposit limit, that's pretty weak. "
